It is important to note there are numerous ways to code.

This particular example makes reference to the EWrapperImpl.java.

The Impl file was created as a means to store all EWrapper responses.

This would be an exceptional method to maintain a more condensed request file 
    as opposed to building the full wrapper logic every time.

The method used for all other code is built with the intent to be self contained
    beyond what was used from the IBApi files directly.

This was created by Andrew W with the intent of use as distributable sample code.
